        <blockquote>
            <p id="testimony" class="testimony">ðŸ‘§ The children were mesmerised by Kris and the team. They really allowed
                the children to explore and challenges themselves. Ensuring they knew that making mistakes was okay. The
                confidence our children now have is down to the dedication and hard work from Kris and the team. Our
                children now want to go and create their own activities and have the confidence to do this themselves.</p>
