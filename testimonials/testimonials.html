        <p>The children were mesmerised by Kris and the team. They really allowed the children to explore and challenges
            themselves. Ensuring they knew that making mistakes was okay. The confidence our children now have is down
            to the dedication and hard work from Kris and the team. Our children now want to go and create their own
            activities and have the confidence to do this themselves.</p>
